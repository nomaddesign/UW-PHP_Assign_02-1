==================

DataBase Access Layer

Acts as wrapper for PDO Database connections.   

Still IN BETA, work in progress. Struggled to get PDO working correctly. 

* PDO is writing and reading from mySQL DB!  
* Update & Delete need to be added. 
* Setting up SQLlite as a "quick rigged" Mock for Travis
* Still working on understanding Dependency Injection and Mocking DB connections. 
* Travis still trying to Load Ruby instead of PHP ????
